                         Hello, My name is George and I am one of the founders at Social Gaming. My role is to make sure we have events coming up and that everything is in place so everyone has a great time.
                         My favourite game is Valorant. I love this game because you have to work as a team and make sure you can aim with a mouse.

                        Hi, I am Bobby and I am one of the team leaders at Social Gaming. I get assigned a team on the day of the event and my job is to get them to play as a team and win.
                        My favourite game is D&D. Playing at a table seeing people is just the first.
