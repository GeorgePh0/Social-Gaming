# Social Gaming

Social Gaming is a website for people who are looking to join a community of gamers who have the same passion as them.
This website will show people the dates of when the meetups will be happening and where they will be taking place. 
It will also give people the opportunity to contact the team to gain information or if they are having an issue then to report it.

The live website can be found here (put link in here).

### Compatibility

## **Bugs**

When viewing on a mobile, the image at the bottom of the meet the team section would cause the circle to become an oval and the image will be of the sky. 
I fixed this by using css style display: none; which would remove the image for people using mobile.
